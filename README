# Geoffrey: A Discord Bot for Minecraft Servers
Geoffrey was created to be an information source for base and shop locations on Minecraft severs. The bot mainly tracks
base, shop, and tunnel locations. This allows for users to quickly find each other's builds and find shops selling
goods.

Geoffrey can be used on a Discord server or in a private message with the bot.

## Information
Geoffrey was written in python and uses the [Discord.py rewrite](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/rewrite/)
 to interface with Discord and [SQLAlchemy](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/) for database
access.
